Description=A packet of Japanese charcoal from World War II, donated by Col. Richard S. Fixott, M.D., in January 1946. The printed packet, measuring 16 x 10 x 2 cm, has text in both Japanese and English. The English label for the product: Ashes for Pocket Brazier.

The packaged charcoal was meant to be put into a heating device, called a kairo. The Chinese characters on the package are old pre-war forms. Also included with this accession was the lid only from a Japanese medical kit, labelled Marucho Drugbok. The items are in good condition.

Description=A \"revigator\" crock, from the Radium Ore Revigator Company. The cream-colored stoneware crock measures 22.5 cm in diameter at the base, and is marked with the company name and patent date (\"7-16-12\").

Radioactive water was thought by some to be a curative for various ailments. The printed instructions indicate that six or more glasses of water from the crock should be consumed daily. This crock has a push-button dispenser and is lined with radium salts. It was originally purchased for $35 by Mr. Ray Sterton as an addition to his pottery collection, and was subsequently donated by John C. Brougher, M.D., in February 1976.

Creator=Radium Ore Revigator Co.

Description=A \"revigator\" crock, from the Radium Ore Revigator Company. The cream-colored stoneware crock measures 22.5 cm in diameter at the base, and is marked with the company name and patent date (7-16-12). These crocks were sold during the early 20th century as a remedy for \"tired\" water. The jars contained, either as a part of the walls of the jar or as an accessory to the jar, some low-grade radioactive ore. Radioactive water was thought by some to be a curative for various ailments. The printed instructions indicate that six or more glasses of water from the crock should be consumed daily. This crock has a push-button dispenser and is lined with radium salts. It was originally purchased for $35 by Mr. Ray Sterton as an addition to his pottery collection, and was subsequently donated by John C. Brougher, M.D., in February 1976. It is in good condition, with a chip one one side.;;;One of two digital photographs (with 77-314_1_2b.jpg) of a \"revigator\" crock. This image shows a typed letter from the Department of Health and a small newspaper clipping, both collected by the original owner, Ray Sterton.

Image caption reads: In the ninth century Albucasis remarked that a patient can be misled by pain into thinking a sound tooth is a diseased one. In this colored engraving of 1839 by Johann Christian Schoeller, the shoe is on the other foot. The dentist has made the mistake and extracted the wrong tooth from his patient, who is justifiably annoyed. National Library of Medicine, Bethesda.;;;Digital scan of a color print of a caricature depicting a patient complaining that the dentist has just extracted the wrong tooth. The hapless patient sits at a table in the dentist's office, while the well-dressed dentist stands over him holding the pulled tooth. Another patient waits glumly at the door as a woman seems to offer him something in a bowl. The tools of the dentist's trade, including books, skulls, and jarred specimens, line the shelves along one wall.

Description=Image 133 reproduced from Curt Proskauer's Bildgeschichte der Zahnheilkunde (Pictorial history of dentistry). Image measures 17.5 x 21.5 cm. Image description reads: Georges Fattet, born in 1820, succeeded in gaining considerable celebrity as a fashionable Parisian dentist in the reign of Louis Philipp and Napoleon III. This he achieved by commissioning caricatures of himself in the Charivari and other comic papers. The dents osanores which he enthusiastically extolled in five popular publications were nothing more than the carved dentures in common use at the time. Negro servants, silken coats for office hours, poster ads, and his sensational carriage, shaped like a huge denture which bore him through the streets of Paris to the blare of trumpets, all served admirably to make famous the name of Fattet. The pictures drawn by Pingret were later collected in a brochure entitled Vie du Celebrissime et Dentissime Georges Fattet.;;;Digital scan of a color print of a painting of dentist Georges Fattet in his consulting room.

Description=Black and white photograph of 10 male University of Oregon Medical School students aboard the shuttle bus used to transport students and employees from downtown Portland, Oregon to the Marquam Hill campus in Southwest Portland, circa 1924-1926. The shuttle bus is parked in front of the Medical Science Building, later renamed MacKenzie Hall. Two men are sitting in the front seats while one man squats on the driver's side running board and seven men sit in the back. The text below the pasted image, found on page four of the Charles F. Norris photograph album, identifies the passengers from left to right as: William West Sutherland, Robert Lindsay McArthur (driver), Ellsworth Francis Lucas (on running board), Frank Harvey Douglass, Walter Wallace Gilbert, Paul Bailey, William Paul Holbrook, Joseph Bernard McCarthy, unknown passenger, and Harley Rex Shields. The text below the image states that the shuttle bus ran at 8 am and 5 pm, used predominately by \"women and cripples\". At this time, less than 10 women were employed by UOMS. The bus was parked at Nu Sigma Nu house, and an additional shuttle was kept at Alpha Kappa Alpha house.

Description=Digital scan of a 35mm slide. Image of a ball-and-cage style artificial heart valve with protruding metal hooks. The plastic ball has been removed and set next to the cage on a green background, with a ruler included to indicate size. The metal hooks were meant to grab onto tissue as the valve was rotated into place.
